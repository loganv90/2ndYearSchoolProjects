The folders cmput274 and cmput275 contain the coding projects I completed in my second year of university for the classes CMPUT 274 and CMPUT 275.
The details of the problems that the code solves are not included in the folders, and not all the files have READMEs that explain their purpose.


cmput274:
	Assignment1:
		The first major assignment of cmput 274.
		Solves a problem involving transmitting data to a web server.
		The majority of this project is not my own work.
	Assignment2:
		The second major assignment of cmput 274. 
		Enables encrypted communication between two arduinos. 
		The supporting files for this are not included.
	morningProblems:
		Solutions to various simple coding problems.
		Each lecture, I would be given ~40 mins to come up with a solution to the "morning problem" of that day.
	weeklyAssignments:
		Solutions to various coding problems.
		Each week, I would be required to create a solution to the "weekly assignment" of that week.


cmput275:
	Assignment1:
		The first major assignment of cmput 275 (note: this is a group assignment).
		Basis for Assignment2.
		Has two parts. The second part is an extension of the first part.
		Creates an enviromnent on the arduino that allows the user to move a cursor on a scrolling map of edmonton and find restraunts based on their ratings.
		May require extra files in order to run this on an arduino.
	Assignment2:
		The second major assignment of cmput 275 (note: this is a group assignment).
		Continuation of Assignment1.
		Has two parts. The second part is an extension of the first part.
		Added functionality allows the user to select two points on the map of edmonton that will be connected visually and by following the roads on the map.
		This uses a PC as a server because the arduino doesn't have the processing power to calculate a path like this.
		May require extra files in order to run this on an arduino.
	finalProject:
		The final project of cmput275 (note: this is a group project).
		This is a free form project.
		There is a video link in the README that explains the project.
		In short, it is a tower defense game that is played on an arduino.
		May require extra files in order to run this on an arduino.
	morningProblems:
