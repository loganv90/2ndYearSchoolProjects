Assignment 1: Huffman Coding



Running the code:

util.py requires the files bitio.py, compress.py, huffman.py, webserver.py and the wwwroot folder to work properly. To use the code, open a bash terminal and navigate to the wwwroot directory. Then enter the command "python3 ../webserver.py" to open the webserver. Then go to the url "http://localhost:8000" and you will be able to see the webpage which contains an image of Huffman. Note that the port can be changed by modifying the variable port in webserver.py.

To compress a file, you must first place the file you wish to compress into the wwwroot directory. Then open a bash terminal and navigate to the wwwroot directory. Then enter the command "python3 ../compress.py somefile.ext" where 'somefile' is the name of the file that will be compressed and 'ext' is its extension.

To view or download a decompressed version of the file that you just compressed, open the web server and then go to the url "http://localhost:8000/somefile.ext" and you will be able to view or download the decompressed file.
