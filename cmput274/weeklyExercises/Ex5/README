Exercise 5: Counting Lights


Included Files:
	-counting.cpp
	-Makefile
	-README

Accessories:
	-Arduino mega board
	-breadboard jumper wire (11 pcs)
	-5 resistors (330 ohm)
	-5 LEDs
	-3 buttons
	-breadboard
	-computer to Arduino cable

Wiring Instructions:
	-Arduino pin 13 <--> long LED lead |red LED 4| short LED lead <--> resistor 5 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 12 <--> long LED lead |red LED 3| short LED lead <--> resistor 4 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 11 <--> long LED lead |green LED| short LED lead <--> resistor 3 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 10 <--> long LED lead |red LED 2| short LED lead <--> resistor 2 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 9 <--> long LED lead |red LED 1| short LED lead <--> resistor 1 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 7 <--> button lead |button| button lead <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 6 <--> button lead |button| button lead <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 5 <--> button lead |button| button lead <--> Arduino Ground

Makefile Targets:
	-make: builds the project
	-make upload: sends project to Arduino

Running Instructions:
	-build circuit and connect Arduino to VMware
	-use terminal to navigate to the folder that contains the included files
	-use command 'make' then 'make upload' to run counting.cpp on the Arduino
	-now the Arduino will use the LEDs to count in binary. The button connected to pin 6 will increment
		by 1 the number that the LEDs are displaying. The button connected to pin 7 will decrement the 
		LEDs. The button connected to pin 5 will turn off all LEDs and store the last LED combination in 
		memory and then restore this combination on the next press (every first press of this button will 
		save a combination and every second press will load the previously saved combination).
