Exercise 6: Serial Counter


Included Files:
	-serial_counter.cpp
	-Makefile
	-README

Accessories:
	-Arduino mega board
	-breadboard jumper wire (6 pcs)
	-5 resistors (330 ohm)
	-5 LEDs
	-breadboard
	-computer to Arduino cable

Wiring Instructions:
	-Arduino pin 13 <--> long LED lead |red LED 4| short LED lead <--> resistor 5 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 12 <--> long LED lead |red LED 3| short LED lead <--> resistor 4 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 11 <--> long LED lead |green LED| short LED lead <--> resistor 3 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 10 <--> long LED lead |red LED 2| short LED lead <--> resistor 2 <--> Arduino Ground
	-Arduino pin 9 <--> long LED lead |red LED 1| short LED lead <--> resistor 1 <--> Arduino Ground

Makefile Targets:
	-make upload: makes project and sends project to Arduino

Running Instructions:
	-build circuit and connect Arduino to VMware
	-use terminal to navigate to the folder that contains the included files
	-use command 'make upload' to run serial_counter.cpp on the Arduino and 'serial-mon' to enter the
		serial monitor.
	-now the Arduino will use the LEDs to add hex numbers that have been entered to the serial monitor. 
		The hex numbers 0-F that the user types into the serial monitor will increment the LED binary 
		number represented by 0-15. If the space character or the enter/return character is entered
		into the serial monitor (by pressing the spacebar or enter key) then all the LEDs will turn off.
		All other character will do nothing when entered into the serial monitor. Note: the program will
		accept lowercase letters or uppercase letters as hex numbers.
