Assignment 2: Driving Route Finder
Part 1: Server


Included Files:
	-server.cpp
	-heap.h
	-dijkstra.cpp
	-dijkstra.h
	-digraph.cpp
	-digraph.h
	-wdigraph.h
	-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	-Makefile
	-README

Makefile Targets:
	-make dijkstra.o: compiles dijkstra.cpp to create dijkstra.o object file
	-make server.o: compiles server.cpp to create server.o object file
	-make digraph.o: compiles digraph.cpp to create digraph.o object file
	-make server: links dijkstra.o server.o and digraph.o to create server executable file
	-make clean: removes the following files if they exist: dijkstra.o server.o digraph.o server

Running Instructions:
	-Within the directory of the Makefile text file and cpp files, run the command "make" to compile all cpp files. Then use the 
		command "./server" run the program.
	-The program is designed to find the shortest path between two points on the map of edmonton by following the roads on the map.
		While running the program, use the command "R <int1> <int2> <int3> <int4>" to make a request. <int1> and <int2> are integers
		representing the starting latitude and longitude respectively. <int3> and <int4> are integers representing the ending
		latitude and longitude respectively. All the integers representing latitude and longitude must be measuements in degrees that
		have been multiplied by 100000.
	-After making a request, "N <int>" will be outputted. If <int> is 0 then there is no path between the two inputted points and
		you may make another request. Otherwise, a path has been constructed. If a path has been constructed, enter the command "A"
		to acknowlege. After acknowleging, a waypoint will be outputted by the program in the format "W <int5> <int6>" where
		<int5> and <int6> are the latitude and longitude of the waypoint respectively. After a waypoint is outputted, input "A" to
		get the next waypoint until the program outputs "E" which means that the destinatioin has been reached. Once the
		program outputs "E", you may make another request.
