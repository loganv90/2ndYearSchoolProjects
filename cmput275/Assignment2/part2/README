Assignment 2: Driving Route Finder
Part 2: Server + Client


Included Files & Folders:
	-server/
	-client/
	-README (this file)




Server (server/):
	Included Files:
		-digraph.cpp
		-digraph.h
		-dijkstra.cpp
		-dijkstra.h
		-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
		-heap.h
		-Makefile
		-serialport.cpp
		-serialport.h
		-server.cpp
		-wdigraph.h

	Makefile Targets:
		-make serialport.o: compiles serialport.cpp to create serialport.o object file
		-make dijkstra.o: compiles dijkstra.cpp to create dijkstra.o object file
		-make server.o: compiles server.cpp to create server.o object file
		-make digraph.o: compiles digraph.cpp to create digraph.o object file
		-make server: links dijkstra.o server.o digraph.o and serialport.o to create server executable file
		-make clean: removes the following files if they exist: dijkstra.o server.o digraph.o serialport.o server

	Running Instructions:
		-Within the folder server/, run the command "make" to compile all cpp files. 
		-First, start the Arduino program in client/.
		-Second, use the command "./server" run this program.
		-This program is designed to take input from an Arduino running the program in client/. The input taken by this program will
			designate a start and end point on the map of Edmonton. This program will find the shortest path between the start and
			end points by following the roads on the map of Edmonton and provide output to the Arduino so that the Arduino can draw
			the path between the start and end points.
		-This program must be running in order for the Arduino to draw paths, but it has no user functionality.




Client (client/):
	Included Files:
		-client.cpp
		-consts_and_types.h
		-draw_route.cpp
		-draw_route.h
		-lcd_image.cpp
		-lcd_image.h
		-Makefile
		-map_drawing.cpp
		-map_drawing.h
		-serial_handling.cpp
		-serial_handling.h

	Accessories:
		-Arduino mega board
		-9 jumper wires
		-joystick
		-2 buttons
		-breadboard
		-Arduino to PC cable
		-LCD screen

	Wiring Instructions:
		VRx (joystick) <--> Analog Pin A8
		VRy (joystick) <--> Analog Pin A9
		SW  (joystick) <--> Digital Pin 53
		GND (joystick) <--> GND (Arduino)
		+5V (joystick) <--> 5V
		GND (Arduino) <--> Zoom Out Button <--> Digital Pin 47
		GND (Arduino) <--> Zoom In Button  <--> Digital Pin 45
		LCD screen <--> Arduino

	Makefile targets:
		-make: compiles the program
		-make upload: compiles the program and sends it to Arduino

	Running Instructions:
		-Build circuit and connect Arduino to VMware.
		-Within the folder client/, run the command "make upload" to compile all cpp files and run the program to the Arduino.
		-Once the program is running on the Arduino, run the program in server/ on the PC.
		-When both programs are running, you may navigate the map of Edmonton using the joystick and you may use the buttons
			to adjust the zoom level of the map. While the message "FROM?" is displayed at the bottom of the LCD screen, you
			may select a starting point on the map of Edmonton by pressing the joystick down while hovering over the desired
			starting place with the cursor. Then the message will change to "TO?" and you may select an ending point in the
			same way. When start and end points have been selected, the Arduino will work with the PC to find the shortest
			path from the start to the end (following the roads on the map) and the path will be displayed on the LCD screen.
			After a path has been drawn, you may select a new start and end and the process repeats.
