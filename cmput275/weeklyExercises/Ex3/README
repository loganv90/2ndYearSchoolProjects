Exercise 3: Pseudocode to Code


Included Files:
	-flipflop.cpp
	-textmatch.cpp
	-Makefile
	-README

Makefile Targets:
	-make flipflop.o: compiles flipflop.cpp to create flipflop.o object file
	-make flipflop: links flipflip.o to create flipflop executable file
	-make textmatch.o: compiles textmatch.cpp to create textmatch.o object file
	-make textmatch: links textmatch.o to create flipflop executable file
	-make clean: removes the following files if they exist: flipflop.o flipflop textmatch.o textmatch

Running Instructions:
	-Within the directory of the Makefile and cpp files, run the command "make flipflop" or "make textmatch" to
		compile either cpp file. Then use the command "./flipflop" or "./textmatch" respectively to run the program.
	-When running the flipflop program you will be prompted to enter the length of an array. Input a length from
		1 to 200 and press enter. Then type a space separated list containing the elements of the array. These 
		elements must all be 32-bit non-negative integers. Once all elements of the array have been entered the
		program will sort them and output the sorted list of elements from smallest to largest.
	-When running the textmatch program you will be prompted to enter two strings. Once both strings have been
		entered, the program will find all the times the first string appears within the second string and it will
		output all the starting indicies in the second string where the first string exists.
