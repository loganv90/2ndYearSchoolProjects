Exercise 5: Graph Concepts


Included Files:
	-digraph.cpp
	-digraph.h
	-graph_concepts.h
	-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	-Makefile
	-README

Makefile Targets:
	-make graph_concepts.o: compiles graph_concepts.cpp to create graph_concepts.o object file
	-make graph_concepts: links graph_concepts.o to create graph_concepts executable file
	-make clean: removes the following files if they exist: graph_concepts.o graph_concepts

Running Instructions:
	-Within the directory of all the incuded files, run the command "make" to compile and link necessary files and create
		the graph_concepts executable. Then use the command "./graph_concepts <text file with graph information>" to run 
		the program. The only included text file with graph information is edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt so run the command
		"./ graph_concepts  edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt".
	-The program will count the number of individual connected graphical components in the graph it creates from the text
		file and then it will output that number.
