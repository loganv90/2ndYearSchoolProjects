Exercise 6: STL Concepts Description


Included Files:
	-complex_postfix.cpp
	-student_hash.cpp
	-Makefile
	-README

Makefile Targets:
	-make complex_postfix.o: compiles complex_postfix.cpp to create complex_postfix.o object file
	-make complex_postfix: links flipflip.o to create complex_postfix executable file
	-make student_hash.o: compiles student_hash.cpp to create student_hash.o object file
	-make student_hash: links student_hash.o to create complex_postfix executable file
	-make clean: removes the following files if they exist: complex_postfix.o complex_postfix student_hash.o student_hash

Running Instructions:
	-Within the directory of the Makefile and cpp files, run the command "make" to compile both cpp files. Then use the 
		command "./complex_postfix" or "./student_hash" to run the either program.
	-When running the complex_postfix program, you can create an equation in postfix notaion with complex numbers that will
		be solved. The elements of the equation should be inputted one at a time from the front of the equation to the back
		of the equation. A complex number can be inputted using the command "V <int1> <int2>" where int1 is an integer
		representing the real part of the complex number and int2 is an integer repersenting the imaginary part. The unary 
		operator conjugation can be inputted with the command "U c". The unary operator negation can be inputted with the
		command "U -". Binary operators subraction, addition, and multiplication can be inputted with the commands "B -", 
		"B +", and "B *" respectively. Once the entire equation has been inputted, enter the command "S" to solve the equation.
	-When running the student_hash program, you can create and alter a database of students with certain commands. The 
		database will start out empty but, students can be added with the command "I <name> <id> <grade>" where name is the 
		name of the student, id is the integer identification number of the student, and grade is the grade of the student in
		an integer format. Searches for students can be preformed with these commands: "Q n <name>", "Q i <id>", and
		"Q g <grade>". These command will print all students with these characteristics (note that identification numbers are
		unique to one student). The command "R <id>" will remove the student with the given identification number. Finally,
		the command "S" will end the program.
